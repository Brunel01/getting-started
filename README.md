# Todo list simple app
This work was foccused on the containarization of a simple todo list manager that runs on Node.js. The overall project was divided into 2 parts: containarization using Dockerfile and next we used Docker Compose.

## Dockerfile
In this first task we build the container image useing a Dockerfile. 

## Docker Compose
Weâ€™ve been working with single container apps. But,we needed MySQL so that we could be able persist our database and respond rapidly to the needs and demands of App users. With more than 2 containers Docker COmpose is a must.

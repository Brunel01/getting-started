# Todo list simple app
This work was foccused on the containarization of a simple todo list manager that runs on Node.js. The overall project was divided into 2 parts: containarization using Dockerfile and next we used Docker Compose.

## Dockerfile
In this first task we build the container image using Dockerfile. 

## Docker Compose
Weâ€™ve been working with a single container app. But, we needed MySQL so that we could be able persist our database and respond rapidly to the needs and demands of App users. With more than 2 containers Docker COmpose is a must.
